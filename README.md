ThunderSync-snap-mirror
=======================

snapshot or mirror of ThunderSync [1]

Unfortunately, there is currently no repository for the original
source code, see [2].  Therefore, I created this snapshot mirror
as a temporary repository for myself.

This is a snapshot of the Thunderbird extension "ThunderSync" as
downloaded from Mozilla's download areas, with the following
updates:
