ThunderSync-snap-mirror
=======================

snapshot or mirror of ThunderSync

This is a snapshot of the Thunderbird extension "ThunderSync" as
downloaded 2012-12-13, the version used is:

md5sum thundersync@frank.abelbeck.xpi 
44d6fcf18585eb38cf8ccf1b6b8aa136  thundersync@frank.abelbeck.xpi

Unfortunately, there is currently no repository for the original
source code, see [2].  Therefore, I created this snapshot mirror
as a temporary repository for myself.
