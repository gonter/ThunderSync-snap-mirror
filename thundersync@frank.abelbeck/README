Version......: 2.2a (2013-06-04)
Licence......: GNU General Public License version 2

Description..: Allows to synchronise Thunderbird's addressbook with external
               directories/files. Right now, only vCard version 2.1 is
               supported as export file format.
               
               Most information of Thunderbird's addressbook is translated into
               the vCard format. Untranslatable stuff is coded as
                  X-MOZILLA-PROPERTY:PropertyName;PropertyValue.
               
               Yes, this extension processes your contact images! That was the
               point of this extension! I wanted nice pictures of the people
               calling me.

Disclaimer...: I created this extension to solve a sync problem with my phone.
               ThunderSync is distributed in the hope that it will help other
               people with similar problems. This extension does access your
               Thunderbird addressbook, so please be cautious! I seek
               perfection, but I cannot verify the extension's behaviour due to
               the overwhelming number of possible platform configurations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quick Start Guide #1: Post installation

Open the extension's properties dialog. On the left-hand side you will see a
list of your addressbooks. To the right all preferences dedicated to the
selected addressbook are shown -- divided into three sections "General",
"Export Format" and "Filter".

Each addressbook can be configured independently.

To synchronise an addressbook one has to link it to an external resource.
To do this, select an addressbook on the left-hand side. Then your can choose
an export format on the right side, in section "General". With a click on the
button "Choose..." you can pick a file or directory.

Other options and preferences should be self-explaining.

Section "Filter" allows to select individual actions for each detail (name,
e-mail address, phone number) of a contact. First you have to select one or more
contact details from the list. A right-click on the selection will show a
context menu from which you can choose an action. This action will be applied to
all selected contact details.

If export or import of a contact lead to charset problems, section "Export
Format" allows to force a certain charset. You might need to use these options
if you intent to work with exports from third-party programs (which might not
stick to the vCard specs).

Since version 2.0 a small tool is available which takes care of unused images
stored in the user's profile directory. It is accessible with the button at the
bottom of the properties dialog.

Another novelty of version 2.0 is the toolbar button to simplify the access.
If you want to use it, you have to choose menu item

          View -> Toolbars -> Customize...

Find ThunderSync's symbol and drag it to one of the white surfaces (toolbars).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quick Start Guide #2: Usage

If at least one addressbook is mapped to a directory it will be possible to
do a proper synchronisation. Open Thunderbird's addressbook and choose menu
item
          Extras -> Synchronise addressbook...

A new dialog will pop up. Initially ThunderSync should have already compared
local and remote contacts. But with a click on the "compare" button this can be
repeated. A list of differences between your local addressbook and the
external file resources will be built. If both resources are equal, a dialog
will inform you about this.

Otherwise a table will show the differences, with the middle column displaying
the type of difference:

    !=    Content on both sides differs; conflict not resolved
    <>    Content on both sides differs; conflict resolved
    <<    Copy external contact to local addressbook
    >>    Copy addressbook entry to external resource

If at least one '!=' is present, you will not be allowed to start a
synchronisation. You have to resolve the conflict by opening the contact in
question. Simply click on it, this will show all differing properties. Find any
property with a '!=' and double-click on it. A double click toggles between
keeping local information or using the external resource.

When no '!=' is left in the list of differing contacts, the "syncronise" button
will be enabled and you can trigger the synchronisation process.
